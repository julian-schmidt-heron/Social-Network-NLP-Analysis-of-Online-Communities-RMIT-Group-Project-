I am Julian Schmidt-Heron, and am in my third year of my Bachelor of Data Science (Professional) degree at RMIT University.  
`s4002485` is my RMIT student GitHub account. Commits from that account represent my individual contributions (Julian Schmidt-Heron).

Go to the Jupyter notebook files:

- `Reddit Data Extraction.ipynb`  
- `Social Media Analysis.ipynb`  
- `Youtube_Analysis.ipynb`  

...to see the code analysis.

See the `Social Media and Network Analysis Report.pdf` for the complete written report (with figures) for the assignment.

### What I did in the assignment

- Extracted and preprocessed large-scale social media data (105,000+ posts/comments) from Reddit and YouTube for analysis of prompt engineering discussions.  
- Applied natural language processing techniques including topic modeling (LDA), sentiment analysis (VADER), and frequency analysis to uncover key themes and sentiment trends.  
- Built and analyzed social interaction networks using Python (`networkx`), performing centrality measures, community detection, and influence spread simulations with Linear Threshold and Independent Cascade models.  
- Visualized network structures and influence propagation with Gephi, leveraging ForceAtlas2 layouts and node ranking by activation frequency.  
- Used GitHub and Microsoft Teams to manage collaborative software development, issue tracking, and code integration in a version-controlled team environment.
- Received HD mark for final submission
